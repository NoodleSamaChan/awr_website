        <div class="post1" style="height:600px;">
        </div>
        <p>🌏 I was born in Vietnam, raised in France and am currently living in the United Kingdom. 
          French is my native language, but I speak English fluently and have a beginner level in Vietnamese.
        <br><br>🖥 I have been working in community management in the gaming industry for over 4 years. 
        I started at Ubisoft as a French Community Representative, then moved on to a Community Manager position. 
        After an experience at Team17, I got a new job at Plaion/PrimeMatter as a Global Community and Social Media Manager. 
      <br><br>🧡 In 2021, I created and co-founded Project AWR (Asian Women Representation), aiming at highlighting Asian women in games while providing them a safe space. 
      We are working towards a better representation and inclusivity of women, people of color and marginalized groups in the gaming industry. 
      This is why we continuously raise awareness on the representation of Asian women in games, and Asians in general.
    <br><br>🇻🇳 In March 2022, I celebrated 1 year of Vietnamese learning – Mình tự hào về chính mình! </p>

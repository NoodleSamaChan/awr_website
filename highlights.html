        <h3>WOMEN‚ÄôS HISTORY MONTH ‚Äì WHAT CAN BE DONE</h3>
        <div class="post3" style="height:400px;"></div>
        <p>Women have been fighting this fight for generations, and the sad truth is that it cannot be done without the help of men. We need men to be allies. This article covers how to be an ally in gaming, but it‚Äôs true for life in general.
          <br><br>But, with or without the help of men, women will continue to fight and carve out spaces to uplift and support one another. With the help of two colleagues, we are now going to show two of these spaces!
          <br><br>First we have Project Asian Representation, created and co-funded by Marion M·ªπ Anh Baxerres, Global Community and Social Media Manager at Prime Matter / PLAION.

        <h5>February 7th, 2022</h5>
        <div class="post6" style="height:400px;"></div>
        <p>With exactly four weeks to go until the MCV/DEVELOP Women In Games Awards, we are very pleased to reveal the shortlist of candidates across all 13 award categories.
          <br><br>With it being 18 months since the last time we were able to celebrate the women of the UK games industry, and almost three years since finalists, guests and supporters were able to gather in-person, it was no surprise that we received hundreds of detailed testimonials and enthusiastic nominations since announcing the return of the awards late last year. <br>Settling on the most compelling of them was no easy task for our shortlisting panel.
